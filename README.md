# How to use this repo

Go through the markdown files in order, building the things described in them.

Once you've successfully built a thing and made it run, _delete_ it and build something else! In this way you'll build muscle memory with the language.

# Where's the content from?

So far it's all either from these three sources,

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Hands-On Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/)
- [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)

or something I've made up.

# Organizational Note

The chapter numbers on the markdown files are somewhat approximate. The "fractional" chapter numbers are meant to indicate that the material is somewhere between the Rust Book chapters and may not at all emanate from that book.

I should probably just put these on Exercism and delete the repo, but :man_shrugging:
