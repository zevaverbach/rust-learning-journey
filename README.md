# How to use this repo

Go through the markdown files in order, building the things described in them.

Once you've successfully built a thing and made it run, _delete_ it and build something else! In this way you'll build muscle memory with the language.

# Where's the content from?

So far it's all either from these three sources,

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Hands-On Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/)
- [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)

or something I've made up.

# Organizational Note

The chapter numbers on the markdown files are somewhat approximate. The "fractional" chapter numbers are meant to indicate that the material is somewhere between the Rust Book chapters and may not at all emanate from that book.

I should probably just put these on Exercism and delete the repo, but :man_shrugging:

# Additional Resources

Here are some other resources that could probably help reinforce the learnings here, and which in all likelihood will become fodder for some of the koans. They're in approximate order of difficulty, and some are pretty domain-specific:

- [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/38_en.html) - this is wonderful, covers the same topics as the Book, but with more emphasis on what's happening under the hood memory-wise. Also has a REPL/playground thing!
- [Rust Koans](https://github.com/crazymykl/rust-koans) - hey, someone already had this idea! ðŸ˜ƒ
- [Rust Web Development](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development) - by Bastian, looks cool and accessible
- [Advanced Rust Web Learning Journey](https://rustwebdevelopment.com/blog/journey/) - seems like a nice, hardcore learning path once you've got the basics down. By the author of the Manning book below, Bastian Gruber.
- [Rust and Web Assembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html) - Rust and Web Assembly!
